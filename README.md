# Heroes React + TypeScript + Vite
This code repository is an app fabricated based on the course _[React: de Cero a Experto](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-cero-experto/)_
from _[Fernando Herrera](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernando-herrera-b6b204200/)

The course was made on JavaScript, but because of my previous knowledge working with typescript I decided to make
the app on typescript, because thats my end goal with working on react.
